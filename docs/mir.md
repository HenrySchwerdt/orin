# MIR and the OIM ownership verifier (v1)

Normative companion to `compiler/mir/mir.or`. Status: contract defined; implementation in
progress. Relation to spec 07: MIR is the *memory IR* layer; the verifier is the independent
checker of its ownership discipline. It is deliberately small and does not trust the lowering.

## Execution model
A function has locals (`MLocal`) and basic blocks; `blocks[0]` is the entry. Instructions execute
in order; each block ends in exactly one terminator. Scalars (`MInt`, `MUsize`, `MBool`) are plain
values. `MRef` locals point to RC'd heap objects (runtime/orin_runtime.h). Runtime traps
(overflow, bounds, unwrap) are safe outcomes.

## Abstract ownership state (per `MRef` local, per program point)
| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Dead` | uninitialised, moved out, or released — must not be read |
| `Owned` | holds one counted reference; must eventually be released, moved, consumed or returned (a leak is reported as a warning, not an error — leaks are memory-safe) |
| `Unique` | `Owned` and known to be the only reference (after `IMakeUnique`, `IStructNew`, `IArrayNew`) |
| `Borrowed(src)` | uncounted alias, valid while `src` is live and unmodified; `src` is a local or `Param` |
| `Param` | parameters: borrowed from the caller for the whole call |

Plus per-local **hole sets** (slot indices taken by `ITakeField`/`IArrayTake` not yet put back).

## Instruction rules (preconditions → effect). "read x" requires x ∉ {Dead}; for refs also not a
hole slot when reading that slot.
- `ICopy(d, o)`: o scalar or `OStr` → d scalar / Owned-immortal (OStr never needs release).
- `IMove(d, s)`: s Owned/Unique → d gets s's state, s Dead.
- `IBorrow(d, s)`: s live → d `Borrowed(s)` (or `Borrowed(root)` if s is itself borrowed).
- `IDup(d, o)`: o live → d Owned.
- `IRelease(x)`: x Owned/Unique → Dead. Releasing Param/Borrowed/Dead is an **error**.
- `ICall`/`IBuiltin`: all ref args live (any of Owned/Unique/Borrowed/Param/OStr); d Owned.
  A call does not change argument states (borrowed for the call).
- `IStrAppend(x, y)`: x Owned/Unique (stays Owned); y live.
- `IStructNew(d, tag, slots)`, `IArrayNew(d, isRef, elems)`: each ref operand Owned/Unique local
  (→ Dead) or OStr; d Unique.
- `INullary(d, t)`: d Owned (immortal).
- `IGetField(d, o, i)` / `IArrayGet(d, a, i)`: o live, slot i not a hole; ref d → `Borrowed(root(o))`.
- `ISetField(x, i, v)` / `IArraySet(x, i, v)`: x **Unique**; v consumed as for StructNew.
  Effect: invalidates every `Borrowed(x)` local (→ Dead) because the old slot value is released.
- `ITakeField(d, x, i)` / `IArrayTake(d, x, i)`: x Unique; i not already a hole → d Owned, i added
  to holes(x); invalidates `Borrowed(x)` locals.
- `IPutField(x, i, s)` / `IArrayPut(x, i, s)`: x Unique, i ∈ holes(x), s Owned/Unique → s Dead,
  i removed from holes.
- `IMakeUnique(x)`: x Owned/Unique → Unique; invalidates `Borrowed(x)` locals (the object may be
  replaced).
- `IArrayPush(x, v)` / `IArrayPop(d, x)`: x Owned/Unique (→ Owned: the runtime may reallocate);
  invalidate `Borrowed(x)`; v consumed; d Owned.
- Any operation that makes x Dead or mutates it also invalidates `Borrowed(x)`.
- `IDup(d, x)` / `IBorrow(d, x)` where x is Unique demote x to Owned (no longer provably unique).

## Terminators
- `TReturn(Some(o))`: ref o must be Owned/Unique (→ consumed) or OStr. At every return, no local
  may be Unique/Owned other than the returned one (else **leak warning**), and no hole may be open
  (**error**: a hole would leave a dangling slot).
- `TBranch`/`TSwitch`: operand scalar and live.
- `TTrap`: no obligations (the process exits).

## Joins
At a CFG join, states must agree per local, except: {Owned, Unique} join to Owned; any state
joined with Dead is an **error** if the local is used later, otherwise Dead (lowering should
release on all paths). Borrowed(src) must have equal src on all paths. Hole sets must be equal.

## Soundness argument (informal; formalisation: docs/formal.md)
If every function verifies, then (1) every read targets a reference that is counted by some live
owner (Owned/Unique local, a Param's caller-side owner, or the root of a Borrowed chain which is
not mutated/released while the borrow is live) — hence no use-after-free; (2) every release
decrements a count owned by the releasing local exactly once — hence no double free;
(3) in-place writes happen only on Unique objects — hence aliases keep observing old values
(value semantics, spec 03). Assumptions (TCB): the runtime implements the operations as specified;
the C compiler and allocator are correct; the MIR → C emitter is a direct translation.
