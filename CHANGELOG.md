# Changelog

## 0.1.0-alpha.1 (unreleased)
First experimental release of the self-hosted Orin compiler.
- Self-hosted compiler (Orin), reproducible bootstrap (stage2 == stage3).
- Language: Orin-B core, generics, classes with value semantics.
- Pipeline: HIR → MIR → independent ownership verifier → C; owned-parameter inference and
  last-use moves.
- Tooling: `orin check --format=json`, `orin fmt`, `orin lsp`, VS Code extension.
- Formal: Lean model of the RC memory machine; soundness of the MIR ownership checker for the
  structured core (`check_sound`). Not end-to-end verified.
